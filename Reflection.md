### Part 4 - Reflection:  

Now that you have:

- Implemented and tested your own decile score algorithm

- Compared it to the original COMPAS/original decile score

- Analyzed the outcomes using time complexity and proof of correctness

It is time to reflect on the broader implications of your work. Try to touch on the theme of institutional bias and how it appears in data–driven systems, the myth of objectivity in algorithms design, and the importance of ethical awareness/civic responsibility in our work.

Write your answers to the following questions:

Comparison of Scores:

1. How did  your new decile score compare to the original?

2. Were there any consistent patterns or outliers?

3. What surprised you about the differences if surprised at all?

Influence of Variables

1. Your merge sort algorithm used variables such as a number of total prior offenses, days in jail, etc. How do you think these variables might correlate with broader systemic inequalities?

2. Which variables do you think are the most “objective”, and which may be influenced by bias?

Racial Biases in COMPAS

1. You may have realized that the original decile scores and new decile scores are tied to race, even though race was not explicitly included in the formula. How is it possible for race to affect the algorithmic outcomes even when it’s not an input variable like *P*, *J*, and *C*?

2. What does this reveal about how data reflects social structures?

Civic Impact:

1. What responsibilities do computer scientists and data professionals have when building tools that affect real people’s lives?

2. How might algorithmic tools like implementing merge sort be improved to minimize harm for this dataset, if possible at all?

3. How does this assignment influence/change your view of the role of computer science in civic life?
